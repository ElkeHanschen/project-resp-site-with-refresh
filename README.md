# Responsive static page with "site refresh" button

### What is this about?

- use case scenario:
  - main domain is under attack; static site would be the site to redirect to while attack is investigated/fixed
  - once attack is over, re-route back to main domain
- coding task:
  - use simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - the point here is NOT the config of re-directing and re-routing

### This Repo is based on:
